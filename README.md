# firstBlog
 Hey Guys 
 This is my Second Django Project
 I used the basics of my previous note building app and then make it into a new Blog App
 Im a lousy Front End Developer So pardon my not so interactive  cum intuitive UI Design
 
 
 Things Learned :
 1. How to use Class Generated Views also know as Generic Views
 
 
 
 Things that might get Added :
 1. A Comment Section for each entry in the log
 2. Support for Multiple Users to add entries into the blog rather than just the admin
 3. Support for Multimedia Input in the Blog Entry
